Demonstration of a combination of a number of simple concepts ostensibly to play with new syntax:
- 0D
- drawware
- RWR - an SCN (nano-DSL) for rewriting text
- macros for any language
- preserving whitespace in comments and strings
- identifiers containing whitespace
- Ohm-JS
- RT (recursive text)
- debugging using probes
- syntax-driven translation
- explicit stacks
- BEFORE clauses in RWR
- mechanisms

- syntactic vs. Lexical grammars

- Loop in the modern age

- macros for non-Lisp languages
- markup as a programming language
- towards Find and Replace
- Obsidian as a programming editor
- new skin for OhmJS, md and HTML (and CSS?)
- syntax workbench
- 0D
- Drawware
- tokenizing words
- escaping whitespace in strings and comments, thwarting space skipping in strings and comments
	- encode spaces where you want to preserve them (comments, strings)
- tracking provenance of messages instead of tracking serial control flow
