Demonstration of a combination of a number of simple concepts ostensibly to play with new syntax:
- 0D
- drawware
- RWR - an SCN (nano-DSL) for rewriting text
- macros for any language
- preserving whitespace in comments and strings
- identifiers containing whitespace
- Ohm-JS
- RT (recursive text)
- debugging using probes
- syntax-driven translation
- explicit stacks
- DOWN calls in RWR
- mechanisms

- syntactic vs. Lexical grammars

- Loop in the modern age
